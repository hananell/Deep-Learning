Welcome to our RNN acceptor!

The script does not recuire any arguments for part 1
It produces graphs of loss and accuracy of train and dev sets.

For part 2, we have 3 methods of generating bad data: 'Palindrome' , '10NoA' , 'QuarterNoA'.
pass one of these as parameter to generate corresponding bad data, instead of the normal data.
the script gen_evil.py generates the bad samples.
